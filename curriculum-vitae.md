## Patents

* "Methods of and apparatus for processing computer graphics"
  - A technique for rasterizing graphics primitives without performing frustum
    clipping first. This involves reformulating the rasterization rules to
    handle "external triangles".
  - US8115783B2, https://patents.google.com/patent/US8115783
* "Generating and resolving pixel values within a graphics processing pipeline"
  - A technique for doing custom multi-sample resolving and other custom
    rendering techniques on tile-based GPUs without having to copy the
    tile-buffers into system memory.
  - US8059144, https://patents.google.com/patent/US8059144
* "Graphics filled shape drawing"
  - A tile-based technique for efficiently rasterizing complex vector shapes on
    GPU.
  - US20100265254A1, https://patents.google.com/patent/US20100265254A1
