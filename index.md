# Erik "kusma" Faye-Lund

I'm a graphics programmer, specializing in low-level OpenGL / DirectX, and
other GPU-related development.

I currently work at [Fusetools](https://fusetools.com), as a Principal
Engineer, leading the development of our compiler for the
[Uno](https://www.fusetools.com/docs/uno/uno-lang)-language (a dialect of C#).
I'm also an active contributor to
[fuselibs](https://github.com/fusetools/fuselibs-public), which is the core of
our UI engine.
