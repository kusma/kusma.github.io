I'm a graphics programmer, specializing in low-level OpenGL / DirectX, and
other GPU-related development.

### Professional

I currently work at [Fusetools](https://fusetools.com), as a Principal
Engineer, leading the development of our compiler for the
[Uno](https://www.fusetools.com/docs/uno/uno-lang)-language (a dialect of C#).
I'm also an active contributor to
[fuselibs](https://github.com/fusetools/fuselibs-public), which is the core of
our UI engine.

I've previously worked at [Hue AS](http://hue.no/), building big-scale data
visualization software for the Oil and Gas industry.

Before that, I was one of the first employees at Falanx Microsystems (later
aquired by ARM), where I worked on the
[ARM Mali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali_(GPU)) line of GPUs, with an
emphasis on the OpenGL ES drivers.

### Demoscene

I'm also actively contributing to
[Demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) productions, in particular
under the label [Excess](http://www.pouet.net/groups.php?which=1360). The other
currently active half of Excess is
[Bent "gloom" Stamnes](https://twitter.com/gloom303), whom I also happen to work
with in my day-job.

I've made [a lot](http://www.pouet.net/user.php?who=1383&show=credits) of demos,
and some other notable labels I've released under are:

* [Shitfaced Clowns](http://www.pouet.net/groups.php?which=4843)
* [Carl B](http://www.pouet.net/groups.php?which=2588)
* [Boozoholics](http://www.pouet.net/groups.php?which=2823)

The videos on the top of this page showcase some of these demos.

I've also been involved in organizational work in the demoscene, for instance:

* Being an organizer of the creative competitions at
  [The Gathering](https://www.gathering.org/) in 2001 and 2002.
* Being a [Creative Mentor](https://archive.gathering.org/tg12/en/creative/mentors/)
  at The Gathering 2012.
* Organizing [Kindergarden](http://kg.slengpung.com) in 2003 through 2007.
* Taking part in the [Meteoriks](http://meteoriks.org) jury in 2018.

### Links

You can find the source code of most of my works on
[GitHub](https://github.com/kusma). Here's some highlighted projects, though:

* [Rocket](https://github.com/rocket/rocket): This is a sychronization tool for
  demoscene productions. It's written in C/C++, using [Qt](https://www.qt.io/)
  for the user interface.
* [Grate](https://github.com/grate-driver/grate): This is a reverse-engineered
  driver for the [NVIDIA Tegra 2 GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tegra#Tegra_2).
  It's developed in cooperation with
  [Thierry "tagr" Reding](https://github.com/thierryreding) and
  [Dmitry "digetx" Osipenko](https://github.com/digetx).
* [Pimpmobile](http://pimpmobile.sourceforge.net/): This is a MOD/XM music
  playback engine for the
  [Nintendo Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance).
  It's developed in cooperation with JÃ¸rn Nystad.
* [Very Last Engine Ever](https://github.com/kusma/vlee): This is the source
  code of most of my demos. It's an aging code-base that uses DirectX 9 for
  rendering.
